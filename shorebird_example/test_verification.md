# Todo App Implementation Verification

## âœ… Architecture Compliance

### 1. Bloc Setup
- [x] Single `TodoBloc` provided via `BlocProvider` at main.dart level
- [x] TodoBloc manages all required states: `IdleState`, `LoadingState`, `DevelopmentState`, `SavedState`, `FailedState`
- [x] State management is clean, predictable, and scalable

### 2. Repository Layer
- [x] All asynchronous logic resides within `TodosRepository`
- [x] Clear separation of concerns - no business logic in UI or Bloc
- [x] Repository handles API calls, database operations, and error handling

### 3. Folder Structure
- [x] Follows `features -> feature_name -> [bloc, domain, data, presentation]` structure
- [x] Each layer is clearly defined:
  - **Bloc**: State management and event handling
  - **Domain**: Todo entity and business models
  - **Data**: Repository implementations and data sources  
  - **Presentation**: UI screens, widgets, and components

### 4. UI/UX Requirements
- [x] UI reflects state changes seamlessly with loading indicators, error messages, saved confirmations
- [x] Follows best practices for responsive and intuitive UX
- [x] Matches organizational structure of states for clarity (idle â†’ loading â†’ saved/failure flows)

### 5. Injection and Scalability
- [x] TodoBloc provided in main can be accessed throughout the app
- [x] Architecture supports future expansion without major refactors

## âœ… Implementation Features

### Core Functionality
- [x] **Add Todo**: Create new todos with title and description
- [x] **Edit Todo**: Enter DevelopmentState for editing existing todos
- [x] **Delete Todo**: Remove todos with confirmation dialog
- [x] **Toggle Completion**: Mark todos as completed/pending
- [x] **Clear Completed**: Bulk remove all completed todos

### State Management
- [x] **IdleState**: Ready state with current todos
- [x] **LoadingState**: Shows loading indicators with operation details
- [x] **DevelopmentState**: Special editing mode with different UI
- [x] **SavedState**: Success feedback with auto-transition to idle
- [x] **FailedState**: Error handling with retry options

### User Experience
- [x] **State Indicators**: Visual feedback for current application state
- [x] **Loading Feedback**: Progress indicators during async operations
- [x] **Success Messages**: Confirmation when operations complete
- [x] **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry options
- [x] **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safety prompts for destructive actions
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- [x] **Empty State**: Helpful message when no todos exist

### Data Management
- [x] **Local Storage Simulation**: In-memory storage with persistence patterns
- [x] **Error Simulation**: 5% chance of simulated network errors
- [x] **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded example todos for demonstration
- [x] **Async Operations**: Realistic delays to simulate network calls

## âœ… Code Quality

### Architecture Patterns
- [x] **Modern Bloc Pattern**: Uses `on<Event>` handlers instead of deprecated `mapEventToState`
- [x] **Equatable Integration**: Proper state comparison and debugging
- [x] **Clean Separation**: Domain, data, and presentation layers are distinct
- [x] **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout with proper null safety

### Error Handling
- [x] **Repository Exceptions**: Custom exception types for clear error communication
- [x] **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even when operations fail
- [x] **User Feedback**: All errors are presented to users with actionable options

### Maintainability
- [x] **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- [x] **Modular Design**: Easy to test and extend individual components
- [x] **Documentation**: Clear comments and structure for other developers
